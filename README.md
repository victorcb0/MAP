# MAP (Multimedia Application Programming)
MAP (Multimedia Application Programming) is a course focused on multimedia application programming and development, involving the use of essential technologies such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition and Blender to model 3D objects. The final product of each laboratory represents the concrete result of the creative process, accompanied by relevant images that document the stages and decisions made during it.
